I inherited two fairly vanilla WooCommerce sites and a third wholesale site built on a different back end, and combined them all into one fully integrated backend system that handles wholesale, retail, CRM, invoicing, reporting, and tradeshows. Visually I haven't changed the front-end much besides managing products, updating images, creating new slides, and adding notices/disclaimers. I'm the sole webmaster/designer/developer for this site and have had great success maintaining and building it for 2 years.
