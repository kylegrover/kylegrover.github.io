Before I showed up these guys were feeling stifled by their LMS. Still a work in progress, the solution we’ve come up with is an integrated eCommerce and eLearning site all built on top of WordPress. It allows students to register, enroll, pay for courses, and take the coursework all online – including lessons, reading, video lectures, discussion boards, homework, interactive web elements and more. This site is a load of fun and is only getting more interesting the deeper we explore the medium.
