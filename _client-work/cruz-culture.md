I inherited two fairly vanilla WooCommerce sites and a third wholesale site built on a different back end, and combined them all into one fully integrated backend system that handles wholesale, retail, CRM, invoicing, reporting, and tradeshows. Visually I havenâ€™t changed the front-end much besides managing products, updating images, creating new slides, and adding notices/disclaimers. I was the lead webmaster/designer/developer for this site and had great success maintaining and building it for 3 years, at one point managing 3 other freelancers to push a big sales funnel project.
