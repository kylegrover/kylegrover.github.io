Sometimes you already have a great website, but you have a bad CMS or no CMS at all. Thatâ€™s the situation East Bay Sports was in when someone built them a static site. For a low price I was able to take all of the design and development work that had gone into the website and translate it into a WordPress theme with a robust admin panel allowing them to easily update any image, page, menu item, map address, or anything else they want! Not only that, but now they have the power of the WordPress plugin ecosystem on their side, making it easy for them to make their website do more and more for them.
