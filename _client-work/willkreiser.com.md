**“Help, I’ve been hacked!”**

When I found out my friend Will’s website had been hacked, of course I offered to help to fix it. We logged into his host, backed up his latest files and databases off the server, and reverted to a previous backup (always keep backups!). But oh no, even on his oldest backup, it was still compromised. Now what, is it totalled?  
No way. I copied his site to an isolated development environment, purged clearly malicious data and users, deleted questionable plugins, updated everything, and started a security scan. His website was back in action that day
