## Portfolios, Blogs, Web Stores - Anything you can imagine

Websites are complicated. You're not a web developer, you're a dreamer, an artist or business owner. You probably have a vision, not a wireframe or a written list of web marketing goals. You bring me the vision, I bring you the website. There aren't many places you can get direct one-to-one interaction with a web developer that actually gives a shit about your project. I will talk directly with you to develop a clear understanding of your goals and work with you to help create a functional and helpful home base on the internet.

In the long run, hiring a good developer from the start is much cheaper than all the Tylenol you'll need if you don't.




## Your Santa Cruz Local Business Webmaster

It can be hard to find a good web developer in Santa Cruz - everyone's either old and retired, young and likely to move away next year, or they've been snatched up by an agency locally or over the hill. I've been here for 10 years, have no plans of leaving, and I love working directly with clients.

You don't need to know which tools I use if you don't want to, you'll get a control panel that just works either way, but if you're curious or have specific website needs you can read more about the two main types of sites I build: [static sites](/services/static-sites), great for artists, bloggers, and small businesses, and [wordpress sites](/services/wordpress-sites), for ecommerce, complex projects, and web DIY-ers.
