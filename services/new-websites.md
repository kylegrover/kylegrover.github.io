### Websites starting as low as $400 with ongoing costs as low as $20 <em>per year<em>!

## Portfolios, Blogs, Web Stores - Anything you can imagine

Websites are complicated. You're not a web developer and you don't want to be. You're a dreamer, an artist or business owner. Whether you have a vision, a wireframe or a written list of web marketing goals, or you just have a project or business you want to share with the world: You bring me the vision, I bring you the website. 

> There aren't many places you can get direct one-to-one interaction with a web developer that actually gives a shit about your project. 

I will talk directly with you to develop a clear understanding of your goals and work with you to help create a functional and helpful home base on the internet.

### Already have a website?

Check out my [updates, redesigns & migrations](/services/updates-redesigns-migrations/) page to decide which option is right for you and estimate the cost, or just [send me a message](/contact/).

### What's the best website platform for me?

You don't need to know which tools I use if you don't want to, you'll get a control panel that just works either way. If you're curious or have specific website needs you can read more about the two main types of sites I build: [static sites](/services/static-sites/), great for artists, bloggers, and small businesses, and [wordpress sites](/services/wordpress-sites/), for ecommerce, complex projects, and web DIY-ers.

In the long run, hiring a good developer from the start is much cheaper than all the Tylenol you'll need if you don't.

## Your Santa Cruz Local Business Webmaster

It can be hard to find a good web developer in Santa Cruz - everyone's either old and retired, young and likely to move away next year, or they've been snatched up by an agency locally or over the hill. I've been here for 10 years, have no plans of leaving, and I love working directly with clients.
