## "Is a Static Site Right for Me?"

Probably! Unless your website needs to be _really_ complicated. There are a lot of reasons to love static websites:

* Zero maintenance required
* Unhackable, literally
* Lightning fast

### But what are the limitations of Static Sites?

You can accomplish just about _anything_ with a static site, but there are quite a few things that require a 3rd party service that may or may not cost money, depending on your needs and usage. Some services you might have to pay for if you have a static site include:

* Web stores
* Contact forms, if you have many forms or get a lot of contact submissions
* Comments, if you don't want ads
* Memberships / Paywalls
* Lots of editors / multiple levels of editing permissions

If your website relies heavily on one or more of these features, you might be better served with a dynamic website like Wordpress provides - check out my [comparison of static sites vs Wordpress ](/advice-for-website-owners/static-sites-vs-wordpress-sites) or my [Wordpress website services](/services/wordpress-sites).

Not sure which is right for you? Tell me about your website! I'll let you know what I recommend.
