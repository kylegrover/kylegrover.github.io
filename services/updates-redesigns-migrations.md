#### Modern Responsive Redesigns • Platform Migrations • Hacked Website Recovery

## Web Design Updates & Website Theme Redesigns

Has your website gotten to look dated or broken? Technology moves quickly, and design doesn't always age well. Whether you want a few things changed or you want to redo the entire site, I can work with you to create and implement a new look that meets modern standards while uniquely representing your brand.

## Server Migrations & Managed Website Hosting

If your website is doing well, it'll eventually outgrow it's hosting plan and will probably need to move to a new server. If your web host sucks (_for instance, GoDaddy_), you'll eventually get sick of them and want to move your site to a new server. Server migration can be complicated and frustrating, but an experienced professional can assure a quick and safe migration with little to no downtime for end-users. Contact me before you make the jump and I can help guide you to the best hosting for you, whether that's through my personal private hosting or one of my recommended 3rd parties.

## Changing or Adding CMS (Content Management Systems)

If managing your website has become a complicated chore, or if you can't control your website's content at all, it might be time for a new CMS, such as Wordpress, Contenful, or Shopify. I can help you choose, set up, and learn a new CMS without disrupting your site design, search ranking, or anything else on your server. A better, happier editing experience is just a conversation away.
