#### Collect and Organize Business Data • Recreate Public Websites • Track Web Activity

The internet is a nearly bottomless source of data, are you utilizing it? If you can find something online, there is almost certainly some way to automate the collection of that data. I've helped a client recreate the databases for their broken websites by crawling and analyzing their archived pages. I've helped a client integrate live API data into a running ticker on their financial website. Other companies have just needed their existing data organized in a way that helped them, along with tools that allow them to interact with that data in meaningful and informative ways.
