Wordpress can be a pain to manage, especially as the site ages, the database grows, and the theme and plugins get older and less supported - or just outright hacked or broken. Sometimes it gets to be too much and you just want to throw it out and start over. Well, if you want to do that, [we can do that](/services/updates-redesigns-migrations), but before you take that leap there are some simpler steps to try,
- Automate workflows & integrate services
- Build or simplify your user interfaces
- Hire a web manager to do it all for you!
