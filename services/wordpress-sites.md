## Santa Cruz's Wordpress Expert

### Why do I love Wordpress?

* It's powerful
  your website can do _anything_ you can dream of. Seriously
* It's open source
  You own your website, 100%. If you have a Shopify or Squarespace site you're limited to the tools and options they provide - and that company folds, your site folds with it. With WordPress you own a working copy of all the code, to live on your web server and be moved around and modified as you please.
* The community is enormous and helpful
  this makes it a lot easier for website owners and web developers to add new features

And I could keep going. There's a reason Wordpress has been the most popular CMS for years. If you're interested in building a new Wordpress site, talk to me! I've built over a hundred of 'em, and I can use that experience to guide you in the right direction. I can handle any and every aspect of getting your website going, from branding, marketing, and design to custom development, server management, and hosting.
