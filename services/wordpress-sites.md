### Why do I love Wordpress?

- It's powerful
your website can do _anything_ you can dream of. Seriously
- It's open source
You own your website, 100%. If you have a Shopify or Squarespace site you're limited to the tools and options they provide - and that company folds, your site folds with it. With WordPress you own a working copy of all the code, to live on your web server and be moved around and modified as you please.
- The community is enormous and helpful
this makes it a lot easier for website owners and web developers to add new features
